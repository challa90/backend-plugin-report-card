This page attempts to draw attention to Jenkins plug-ins which require an old,
sometimes *very* old, version of Jenkins -- this is known to developers as the
'Required Core'. Having lots of disparate required core versions makes it
painful for developers to fix bugs in lots of plug-ins concurrently because
Maven will suffer from "download the internet" syndrome due to the multitude
of dependencies required to make Jenkins function.

Therefore it is in the interest of both developers and users to rally around
specific versions of the core.. and hence, this automated page. 

\\

|| Required Core || Group Id || Artifact Id || Version || SCM ||
#foreach( ${oldPlugin} in ${oldPlugins} )
| $!{oldPlugin.parentVersion} | $!{oldPlugin.effectiveGroupId} | $!{oldPlugin.effectiveArtifactId} | $!{oldPlugin.effectiveVersion} | [$!{oldPlugin.repositoryUrl}] |
#end
